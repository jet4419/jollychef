Problem #1 (Ordering):
	- When the order stuck in a certain customer. 
	- It will stay there and will continue to 
	- decrease the qty of a product.
Solution #1:
	- Show the real quantity of current product's qty.
	- When the customer was ordered a product.
	- Don't deduct right away their orders.
	- Should be deducted in the last process of ordering.
Solution #2:
	- Show the current quantity of the product.
	- And only deduct each customer's order quantity 
	- (Don't deduct the other customer's order).

Sample query:
SELECT daily_meals.prod_id, daily_meals.prod_name, daily_meals.prod_price, daily_meals.qty - (IIF(ISNULL(orders_holder.qty), 0, SUM(orders_holder.qty))) AS qty, daily_meals.category, orders_holder.id FROM daily_meals LEFT JOIN "c://jollychef/2021-01" ON daily_meals.prod_id = orders_holder.prod_id AND (orders_holder.status = 'Pending' OR orders_holder.status = 'On Process') WHERE orders_holder.cust_id=9 GROUP BY daily_meals.prod_id ORDER BY daily_meals.prod_brand, daily_meals.prod_name
