Problem #1 (Ordering):

	It will stay there and will continue to 
	decrease the qty of a product.
Solution #1:

	When the customer was ordered a product.
	Don't deduct right away their orders.
	Should be deducted in the last process of ordering.
Solution #2:
	Show the current quantity of the product.
	And only deduct each customer's order quantity 
	(Don't deduct the other customer's order).
